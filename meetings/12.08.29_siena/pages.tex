\begin{frame}{libzero}{}
	\begin{block}{New library: libzero}
		\begin{itemize}
		  \item Based on pf\_ring DNA
		  \item Better concurrency (better performance)
		  \item Larger buffer (Smaller risk of packet loss)
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{pf\_ring DNA and libzero made by nTop}
		\begin{itemize}
		  \item Implemented by nTop (Luca Deri)
		  \item Sponsored by Silicom (network cards)

		\begin{itemize}
		  \item Luca's qote was refering to test licenses
		  \item Now we have to pay!!!

	\begin{block}{Two possibilities}
		\begin{enumerate}
		  \item Buy licenses:
		  	\begin{itemize}
			  \item DNA: 250\$ per port
			  \item libzero: 500\$ per port
			\end{itemize}
			\item Buy dualport Silicom NIC: 600\$
			\item Buy dualport Silicom NIC with libzero: 990\$
		\end{enumerate}

	Michael Lvovsky: ``For 60 pcs I will make you a special price of 200\$ instead
	of 250\$ regular price''
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Libzero}{Would have been nice}
	\begin{block}{``Libzero is something that comes for free with Silicom NIC''}
		 Silicom disagrees with this qote by Luca (990\$ instead of 600\$ per
		 dualport NIC)!
	\end{block}
	\begin{ergo}
		Libzero would have been nice but it's not worth the price!
	\end{ergo}

\begin{frame}{Proceedings}{}
	\begin{block}{We can sell the old (10) NICs for about 200\$ each}
		The old NICs were very cheap coming with the CERN conditions from DELL. Mainz
		computing guys are interested in buying those for about 200\$. This way we
		would spend 600\$ per Silicom dualport NIC.
	\end{block}
	
	\begin{block}{We can keep the old NICs and buy licenses}
		This would be 200 + 250 = 450 dollar per NIC (only one license!)
		\\
		Two licenses per NIC would be 700\$ per NIC.
