			to quickly switch between different approaches
		\vspace{2mm}
		\item Special driver needed for lossless communication: pf\_ring
		\vspace{2mm}
		\item Unsteady data production allows new approaches
		 	 \begin{itemize}
			  \item Considering trigger levels as logical object, not as real farms saves
			  a lot of money
			\end{itemize}
		\vspace{2mm}
		\item The new farm design allows us to have a central software
