		Luca told us that the licenses are for free for people doing research
	\end{block}
	
	\begin{block}{July 2012}
		``We can provide you a few testing licenses, but Silicom manages DNA, not us. We just did the development. 
		\textbf{If you buy cards from them then you won't be (charged) for DNA.}''
	\end{block}
	
	\begin{block}{October 2012 Marco wrote with Luca in CC}
			``For the 10G boards which Jonas is using we can have free licenses for
			PF\_RING only, but DNA (libzero) requires Silicom licenses.''
	\end{block}
	
	\begin{ergo}
		It's pretty clear: We have to pay for licenses. 
		
		\ldots or isn't it?!

\begin{frame}{Do we have to pay for pf_ring DNA?}{}
	I've posted the news in Siena with the words ``Luca's qote was refering only to
	test licenses - Now we have to pay!!!'
	
		\begin{block}{Jan 2014: Luca found these slides on the web and wrote me}
			``I have told you, and I repeat that once more, that I donâ€™t want money from
			people who do research, but I expect non-research people to pay.''
			
			``Next time you make incorrect public statements make sure that what you state
			is correct. If unsure you better ask.''
			
			``Silicom funded us for some time and in return they asked to buy their
			cards. If you want to buy their competitors cards you have to pay licenses''

		What's wrong with this guy?

\begin{frame}{Do we have to pay for pf_ring DNA?}{}
	My interpretation is that he offers licenses for free but would prefer if we
	pay for it.
	
	After trying to clear up misunderstandings he's only sent two messages:
	
	\begin{block}{``I have nothing to do with Silicom anymore''}
			Does that mean that we should not buy Silicom NICs but order the licenses
			directly from ntop?
	\end{block}
	
	\begin{block}{``Just stop using emails from 2012''}
		It seems like he refuses to	coummunicate properly. 
	\end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What now?}{}
	
	\begin{block}{Maybe someone from Pisa should meet him?!}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Should we buy Silicom or other NICs?
				\item Can we have a discount? Silicom offered 60 licenses for 200 \$ instead
				of 250 \$
			\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	
	\begin{ergo}
		Let's assume that we have to either buy Silicom NICs (600\$) or Licenses
		(200\$) + Intel cards (450\$)
\end{ergo}

\section*{PCs}

\begin{frame}{No more special condition PCs from Dell}{}
	\begin{block}{There are still some items available from Dell}
		\begin{itemize}
		  	\item 48 port SFP+ switch for only 7k\euro (with 2 x 40 GBps uplinks) 			  	
  			\item 16 port KVM switch for about 1,2 k\euro

\begin{frame}{Do it yourself PCs}{}
	\begin{block}{A cheap alternative}
		\begin{itemize}
	  		\item Buy mainboard, CPU, RAM, PSU, NIC separately
	  		\item Build ``shelves'' for the racks
	  		\item Put the assembled mainboards on the shelves without any case
	  		\item Use the backdoor fans for cooling
	  			  		 
		\end{itemize}	
	\end{block}
	
	The following prices are based on alternate.de (big discount to be expected!)

\section*{Cryptocoin mining}
\begin{frame}{Make money with GPUs}{}
	\begin{block}{Most probably not feasible but..}
		A single ATI 7970 mines around 150 \euro a month while consuming around 300
		watts
		
		If we'd pay 0.1 \eur~ /kWh it would still be 110 \euro~a month
	\end{block}
	
	\begin{block}{Do it like video rendering companies}
		Let the GPUs mine during idle time: 70\% idle would make 65\euro~a month
		
		60 cards would make about 3900 \euro~ (or 2 new PCs) a month!
